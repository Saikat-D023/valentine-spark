# 💝 Valentine's Proposal Website for Aranya

## Overview
A cute, playful, and interactive Valentine's Day proposal page with two screens, fun animations, and a confetti celebration.

---

## Screen 1: The Proposal
- **Cute & playful design** with a pink/red Valentine's theme, rounded cards, hearts, and a playful handwritten-style font
- **Cat GIF** displayed prominently at the top (your custom GIF)
- **Proposal text**: "Aranya, will you be my Valentine? 💕"
- **Two buttons**:
  - **"Yes" button** — clickable, takes you to the celebration screen
  - **"Umm..." button** — this one **runs away from the mouse cursor** whenever you try to hover/click it, making it impossible to say no 😄
- Floating hearts animation in the background using Framer Motion

## Screen 2: The Celebration 🎉
- Big **"Yaay!"** text with a bouncy entrance animation
- **Confetti explosion** filling the screen with hearts and colorful particles
- Your **cat GIF** displayed again in a cute card
- A sweet follow-up message like "I knew you'd say yes! 💗"
- Sparkle/shimmer effects around the card

## Tech & Libraries
- **React + Vite + Tailwind** (project's existing stack)
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations (button dodging, entrance effects, floating hearts)
- **canvas-confetti** for the confetti/hearts explosion on the celebration screen
- Cute color palette: pinks, reds, soft whites, with rounded corners and heart motifs everywhere
